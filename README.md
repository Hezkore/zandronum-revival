# Zandronum - Revival

Revive your survival team mates by picking up keys!

## Description

"Revival" is an extremely simple modifier for the Survival mode in [Zandronum](https://zandronum.com).\
Any player who has died in the current round will be revived when a living player picks up a key.

## How to Use

1. Download the `revival.wad` to your Zandronum directory
1. Load the mod using the `-file` command line argument
2. Play Survival like normal

## Things to improve

The instant revival can be jarring.\
A message should appear on each dead player's screen with a countdown before they are revived.

An option for adjusting the countdown time could also be added.\
At the end of the countdown, it could check if at least one player is still alive.\
This would prevent a player from rushing to pick up a key to revive any dead players and then dying themselves.
